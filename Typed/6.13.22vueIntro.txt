Need to know directives for Vue:
Directive = special HTML attributes that allow you to manuipulate the DOM.

v-if = Display element if variable is true. (Creates and Destroys)
v-else = Display element if variable is not-true. (Creates and Destroys)

v-show = Display element if variable is true.(Doens't work with v-else; 
            loads all at once)
v-on = Action(Event) to element. i.e: ":click", ":mouse", ":mouseover" 
    https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide/events.html   (Event Handling)
v-for = Creates an instance of all innnerHTML i.e: "item in items" loops 
        through each item in  items. (Looping over array structure in code)
v-model = Binds question variable and input value together, goes both ways. 
            (Used with input)
v-bind:style = "{color: '#fff'}" would turn all text within element white.
                i.e: ":disabled", ":class", ":id"

if text is hanging on refresh
